3. Launch Star Citizen

**Note:** `r_DisplayInfo = 2` (white text in top-right of screen) is required for this mod to function. We will automatically add the console command `r_DisplayInfo = 2` to the `StarCitizen\LIVE\user.cfg` file which will run every time you start the game. Restart the game upon installation or run the console command yourself in-game by pressing ` (tilda). To get rid of the white text, delete it from that file and do not run this mod.
